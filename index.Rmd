## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to immigration, and the effect of the implementation of certain immigration laws/policies on immigration numbers. What laws/policies caused an increase in the number of immigrants entering US every year? What laws/policies caused a decrease on those numbers? These are the questions I want to research and answer through this final project.
